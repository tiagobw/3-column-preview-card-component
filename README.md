## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

While working through this project, I had to tweak the build scripts to deploy the project. I know I should've used Webpack or a similar tool for this job, but I preferred to use a more manual workflow for such a small project.

I like better to use the BEM CSS methodology, but in this case, I wanted to give a framework a shot, and my favorite is Tailwind CSS.

The projects from Frontend Mentor are great for messing around with a variety of technologies.
